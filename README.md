# flash-games

These are a few flash games I enjoyed playing in my teens, the ones I could remember at least. I'm gathering them here for preservation mostly for own nostalgic enjoyment. I personally hate flash in the browser, I use [flashplayer-standalone](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flashplayer-standalone/) on Linux to play these SWF files.

Notes:
* Motherload is modified (not by me) to be unlocked for local play; buyer beware.
* `mrsound.swf` are the sound files required to play Madness Interactive locally.
* None of these games belong to me, I have no rights / claims to anything found here.
